WireGuard is a VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography. It is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces
and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

WireGuard is not yet complete. You should not rely on this code. It has
not undergone proper degrees of security auditing and the protocol is
still subject to change.

Optional Dependency

openresolv is an optional runtime dependency -- you need it if you want
to use to use wg-quick's DNS option.

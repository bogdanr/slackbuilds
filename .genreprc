# Either use gpg or gpg2:
GPGBIN="/usr/bin/gpg"

# Optionally use gpg-agent to cache the gpg passphrase instead of letting the
# script keep it in the environment (note that if you define USE_GPGAGENT=1
# but gpg-agent is not running, you will get prompted for a passphrase every
# single time gpg runs):
USE_GPGAGENT=0

# Generate slack-requires, slack-suggests, and slack-conflicts lines in the
# metadata files by setting FOR_SLAPTGET to "1" -- these are used by slapt-get 
FOR_SLAPTGET=1

# Follow symlinks in case the repository has symlinks like 14.0 -> 13.37
# indicating that one package works for those two Slackware releases.
# If the script does _not_ follow symlinks, then the symlinks will appear in
# the repository listing instead of the packages they point to.
FOLLOW_SYMLINKS=1

# If the repository has separate package subdirectories (for separate
# Slackware releases or architectures) then define them here.
# Separate FILELIST.TXT, MANIFEST etc.. files will be created for all of them:

The Wayland display server

 Wayland is a project to define a protocol for a compositor to talk
 to its clients as well as a library implementation of the protocol.
 The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux
 kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an X application, or a
 wayland client itself. The clients can be traditional applications,
 X servers (rootless or fullscreen) or other display servers.

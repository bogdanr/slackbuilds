IO::Socket::SSL -- Nearly transparent SSL encapsulation for IO::Socket::INET.

This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that uses SSL
to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server or client.
IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one needs to write a
full-featured SSL client or server application: multiple SSL contexts, cipher
selection, certificate verification, and SSL version selection. As an extra
bonus, it works perfectly with mod_perl.

libwww-perl is an optional dependency.

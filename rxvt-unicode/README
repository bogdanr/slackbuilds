rxvt-unicode is an enhanced version of the rxvt terminal emulator.  It has
full unicode and Xft support, does font antialiasing and italics, and has
the same transparency capabilities as ATerm.  It can be extended using Perl.

The slackbuild uses environment variable called CONFIG_PERL to control
whether the embedded perl interpreter will be built. Setting to anything
other than YES during the build will disable it, which will result in a
much leaner package.

pulseaudio is a networked sound server for Unix-like operating systems
and Microsoft Windows. It is intended to be an improved drop-in replacement 
for the Enlightened Sound Daemon (ESOUND).

Pulseaudio will need a pulse group/user to run. You can add one with
	# groupadd -g 216 pulse
	# useradd -u 216 -g pulse -d /var/lib/pulse pulse
See http://slackbuilds.org/uid_gid.txt for details on the uid/gid assignments.

Optional deps: jack-audio-connection-kit, avahi, lirc, libasyncns, orc

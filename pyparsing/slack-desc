# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pyparsing: pyparsing (parsing module for python)
pyparsing:
pyparsing: The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
pyparsing: executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc
pyparsing: approach, or the use of regular expressions.  The pyparsing
pyparsing: module provides a library of classes that client code uses to
pyparsing: construct the grammar directly in Python code.

Calf audio plugin pack for LADSPA, DSSI, LV2 and JACK. Contains effects
(flanger, reverb, tape-like delay, phaser, rotary speaker, multi-mode
filter, multi-tap chorus and compressor) and instruments (organ simulator
and a monophonic synthesizer).

Optional dependencies: By default, these are auto-detected at build time.
Support for each dep will be built if found, unless disabled with an
environment variable.

ladspa_sdk: Disable with LADSPA=no (which will also disable DSSI).
dssi: Disable with DSSI=no.
lv2 and slv2: Disable with LV2=no.
lash: cannot be disabled (will always be used if installed).

Even with all the plugin formats disabled, calfjackhost will still
be built.

To enable some experimental LV2 plugins designed for use with modular
hosts, set EXPERIMENTAL=yes in the environment (default is "no").

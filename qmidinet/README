QmidiNet is a MIDI network gateway application that sends and receives MIDI
data(ALSA Sequencer) over the network, using UDP/IP multicast.

Inspired by multimidicast (http://llg.cubic.org/tools) and designed to be
compatible with ipMIDI for Windows (http://nerds.de).

jack-audio-connection-kit is an optional dependency.

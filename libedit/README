This is an autotool- and libtoolized port of the NetBSD Editline
library (libedit). This Berkeley-style licensed command line editor
library provides generic line editing, history, and tokenization
functions, similar to those found in GNU Readline.

The slackbuild has a build time variable called LIBEDIT_WIDEC, which if set to
`yes', turns on the wide character support of the built libedit library.
Although the support is there, initial testing shows that it acts weird, and
displays Unicode byte sequences instead of the real typed-in characters. You
can experiment with it, but don't count on it until it is cleared up.
The default build option was and is disabled widechar support.

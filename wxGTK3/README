wxGTK3 is part of wxWidgets, a cross-platform API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms that still utilize the native
platform's controls and utilities.

webkitgtk3 is an optional dependency of this package.

NOTE: this package is NOT built using --enable-stl by default.
if you need to enable stl, use STL=yes ./wxGTK3.SlackBuild

wxGTK3 can be installed alongside with wxGTK/wxPython, but it will
overwrite wx-config created by wxGTK/wxPython.
If you need to build packages using wxGTK/wxPython, simply
reinstall wxGTK/wxPython package and wx-config will point to correct version.
The same solution can be used if wxGTK3's wx-config is overwritten.

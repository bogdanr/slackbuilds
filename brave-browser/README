Brave is on a mission to fix the Web by giving users a safer, faster,
and better browsing experience â€“ while growing support for content
creators through a new attention-based ecosystem of rewards.

Much more than a browser, Brave is a new way of thinking about how the
Web works.

Brave is open source, and built by a team of privacy focused,
performance oriented pioneers of the Web, founded by the inventor
of Javascript and co-founder of Mozilla.

Brave is 64-bit software.

This SlackBuild does not build Brave from source, it simply repackages
the binary.

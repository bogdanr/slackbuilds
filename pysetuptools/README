pysetuptools (a collection of enhancements to Python distutils)
Note: the name of the source package is 'setuptools'.  Since 'setuptools'
is such a generic name, this package uses the name 'pysetuptools' to avoid
any potential future conflicts.  The actual installation paths and file 
names are not modified in any way.

setuptools allow you to more easily build and distribute Python packages,
especially ones that have dependencies on other packages.

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

opensc: opensc (SmartCard utilities/libraries for PKCS#11/15 compatible cards)
opensc:
opensc: It provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart cards. Its
opensc: main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and
opensc: facilitate their use in security applications such as mail encryption,
opensc: authentication, and digital signature. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11
opensc: API so applications supporting this API such as Mozilla Firefox and
opensc: Thunderbird can use it. OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims
opensc: to be compatible with every software that does so, too.

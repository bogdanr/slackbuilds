Bazaar (bzr) is a decentralized revision control system, designed 
to be easy for developers and end users alike.  Bazaar is part of the 
GNU project to develop a complete free operating system.

This optionally requires docutils for docs generation, but it is only a 
build dependency - it is not needed for running bzr.  Even without the
docutils package installed, there will still be some documentation with
the package, so you probably don't need it.

Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool - like make, but without make's
wrinkles.  :-)

Ant is extended using Java classes.  The configuration files are XML-based,
calling out a target tree where tasks get executed.  Each task is run by an
object that implements a Task interface.

This package is using upstream's recommendation of ANT_HOME=/usr/share/ant

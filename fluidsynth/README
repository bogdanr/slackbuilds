FluidSynth is a software real-time synthesizer based on the Soundfont 2
specifications. FluidSynth reads and handles MIDI events from the MIDI
input device. It is the software analogue of a MIDI synthesizer.
FluidSynth can also play midifiles using a Soundfont.

If you want to build support for ladspa plugins, you can pass
LADSPA=yes to the script. That requires ladspa_sdk.

Optional deps are lash, portaudio, and jack-audio-connection-kit.

lxml is a Pythonic binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.
It is unique in that it combines the speed and feature completeness
of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API.

Optional dependencies: python3, BeautifulSoup and cssselect

BeautifulSoup can be used in place of BeautifulSoup4.

Note: To install python3 bindings pass PYTHON3=yes to the slackbuild.

  # PYTHON3=yes ./lxml.SlackBuild
